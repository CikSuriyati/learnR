## Week 1 Class 1


### Introduction to basic features of R programming

**Install R**

This tutorial will help you set up your computer to use R. It is for you if you need to:

* Install R on your computer : Click download [_CRAN_](https://www.r-project.org)

* Install the RStudio IDE: Click download [_RStudio_](https://posit.co)

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment for R. What does that mean? Well, if you think of R as a language, which it is, you can think of RStudio as a program that helps you write and work in the language. RStudio makes programming in R much easier and I suggest that you use it!

You can skip this tutorial if you've already done these things.

## Week 1 Class 2

### Logical vectors and relational operators

The variables are assigned with R-Objects and the data type of the R-object becomes the data type of the variable. There are many types of R-objects. The frequently used ones are:

- Vectors
- Lists
- Matrices
- Arrays
- Factors
- Data Frames
