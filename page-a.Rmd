In this topic in week 1, you will learn about :

- basic features of R programming
- Logical vectors and relational operators


The readings in this tutorial follow [_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), section 5.2.

### Introduction to basic features of R programming

**Install R**

This tutorial will help you set up your computer to use R. It is for you if you need to:

* Install R on your computer : Click download [_CRAN_](https://www.r-project.org)

![](https://vimeo.com/203516510)

* Install the RStudio IDE: Click download [_RStudio_](https://posit.co)

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment for R. What does that mean? Well, if you think of R as a language, which it is, you can think of RStudio as a program that helps you write and work in the language. RStudio makes programming in R much easier and I suggest that you use it!

You can skip this tutorial if you've already done these things.

## Operators in R


### Operators in R


Type of operators in R

- Assignment operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Relational operators
- Logical operators


**_1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS_**

The assignment operators in R allows you to assign data to a named object in order to store the data.

```{r echo=FALSE}
data.table::data.table(
     Operator = c("<-", "=", "<<-","->", "->>"),
  Description = c("Leftwards assignment","Left assignment (not recommended) and argument assignment","Left lexicographic assignment (for advanced users)", "Rightwards assignment", "Right lexicographic assignment (for advanced users)")
)

```
Example

```{r}
x <- 2
y = 6
3 -> z
w <<- 7
8 ->> s

x
y
z
w
s

```



**_2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS_**

These operators are used to carry out mathematical operations like addition and multiplication. Here is a list of arithmetic operators available in R.

```{r echo=FALSE}

data.frame(
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
          Operator = c("+", "–", "*", "/", "^", "%%", "%/%"),
       Description = c("Addition","Subtraction",
                       "Multiplication","Division","Exponent",
                       "Modulus (Remainder from division)","Integer Division")
)
```

Example

```{r}
3 + 5   
8 - 3   
7 * 5   
1/2     
4 ^ 4   
4 ** 4  
5 %% 3  
5 %/% 3
```


**_3. RELATIONAL/COMPARISON OPERATORS_**

Comparison or relational operators are designed to compare objects and the output of these comparisons are of type boolean. To clarify, the following table summarizes the R relational operators.

```{r echo=FALSE}
data.table::data.table(
     Operator = c("<", ">", "<=", ">=", "==", "!="),
  Description = c("Less than","Greater than",
                  "Less than or equal to","Greater than or equal to","Equal to",
                  "Not equal to")
)
```

Example 

```{r}
x <- 3
y <- 15

x<y
x>y
x<=5
y>=20
y == 16
x != 5

```

**_4. LOGICAL/BOOLEAN OPERATORS_**

```{r echo=FALSE}
data.table::data.table(
     Operator = c("!", "&", "&&", "|", "||"),
  Description = c("Logical NOT","Element-wise logical AND",
                  "Logical AND","Element-wise logical OR","Logical OR")
)
```



_Example_

```{r echo=TRUE} 
x<-c(TRUE, FALSE, 0,6)
x
```
```{r echo=TRUE} 
x<-c(TRUE, FALSE, 0,6)
y <- c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)

!x
```

Operators & and | perform element-wise operation producing result having length of the longer operand.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE} 
x<-c(TRUE, FALSE, 0,6)
y <- c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)

x&y
```

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE} 
x<-c(TRUE, FALSE, 0,6)
y <- c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)

x|y
```


But && and || examines only the first element of the operands resulting into a single length logical vector.


```{r echo=TRUE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
x<-c(TRUE, FALSE, 0,6)
y <- c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)

x&&y
```

Zero is considered FALSE and non-zero numbers are taken as TRUE.

```{r echo=TRUE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} 
x<-c(TRUE, FALSE, 0,6)
y <- c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)

x||y
```




Let’s summarise the main points of this tutorial.

- The three most important logical operators are NOT, AND and OR.
- In R, the NOT operator is the exclamation mark.
- The AND operator is the ampersand.
- The OR operator is the vertical bar.
- Logical operators are often used to subset vectors or data frames.
