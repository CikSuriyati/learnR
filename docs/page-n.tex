  using R programming.
\item
  You may choose any dataset that is freely available and conduct a
  proper data analysis procedure.
\item
  Demonstrate and promote your ability to analyse data from scratch in a
  meaningful manner.
\item
  The objective of the data analysis and presentation is to promote
  self-skill in analysing data and knowledge transfer to the community.
\item
  \textbf{AT LEAST ONE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS and ONE INFERENTIAL
  STATISTICS} should be included in the analysis.
\item
  The presentation should be delivered in public with the following
  requirements:
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  Introduction
\item
  Objective(s)
\item
  Methodology
\item
  Analysis (Demonstrate the steps of analysis using RStudio).
\item
  Results
\item
  Conclusion
\item
  Benefit of the analysis
\end{enumerate}

There is no restricted format in presentation delivery.

\textbf{NOTE:} It is advisable to create a social media group with many
stakeholders from industries, academics, and local community.
