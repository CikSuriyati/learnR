- Correlation test
- Linear regression (simple and multiple linear regression)

## Week 11 Class 1

### Test of mean (single mean,independent t-test) 
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Week 11 Class 2
