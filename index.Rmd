# **Introduction to Statistical Programming**

R is a powerful, versatile and free statistical programming language, which has become increasingly popular among industrial and academic data analysis. These introduction course assume no previous coding experiences in R or any other programming language.

This course will provide students with extensive skills of fast computing on how to organize computations to access, transform, explore, analyze data and produce results. The primary focus is on teaching the concepts and vocabulary of statistical computing. The ultimate goal is that the students would be able to work in an office, lab or as a research assistant to do essential computations and that they would be able to legitimately put computing skills on their resume. 

The method of teaching and learning included lecture, lab work and project which should be held in the statistics laboratory. The assessments consist of project, quiz and test.


## Assessments Breakdown

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
df <- data.frame(Cat = c("Presentation", "Quiz", "Test", "Written Report"), 
                 Quiz = linebreak(c("Face to face", "Online", "Lab Test", "Written Report")), 
                 Test = linebreak(c("25%", "15%","30%","30%")))
kable(df, col.names = c("Assessment Type", "Assessment Description", "% of Total Mark"), escape = F, caption = "Details of Continuous Assessment") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```
